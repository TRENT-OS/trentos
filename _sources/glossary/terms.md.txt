| badge                      | An seL4/CamkES concept to assign IDs to communication endpoints, which can't be manipulated and thus are sufficient to identify a caller.                                                                                                                                                                                 | <https://docs.sel4.systems/Tutorials/notifications.html> |
| CMake                      | Open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <https://cmake.org>                                      |
| component<br>[CAmkES term] | A type of functional entity. It is important to stress this distinction. ‘Component’ is used colloquially to refer to both types and instances, but in a formal sense ‘component’ refers only to the type. To make this more concrete, the statement component foo f describes a component instance f, whose type is foo. | <https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/camkes/terminology>  |
| connector<br>[CAmkES term] | A type of link between instances. The distinction between ‘connector’ and ‘connection’ is the same as that between ‘component’ and ‘instance,’ i.e. a connection is an instantiation of a particular connector.                                                                                                           | <https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/camkes/terminology>  |
| dataport<br>[CAmkES term]  | Port interfaces that are used by a component. A component’s dataports are expected to be available to it at runtime as shared memory regions.                                                                                                                                                                             | <https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/camkes/terminology>  |
| ninja                      | Small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.                                                                               | <https://ninja-build.org>                                |
| QEMU                       | Hosted virtual machine monitor: it emulates the machine's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems.                                                                               | <https://www.qemu.org>                                   |
| seL4                       | High-assurance, high-performance operating system microkernel. It is unique because of its comprehensive formal verification, without compromising performance.                                                                                                                                                           | <https://sel4.systems>                                   |
