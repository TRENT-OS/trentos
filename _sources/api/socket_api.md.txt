# Socket API

## Overview

The Socket API provides functions to establish and use TCP and UDP communication
channels. The implementation has similarities to BSD Sockets but is not fully
compatible.

The API includes client-side function implementations to communicate with a
Network Stack CAmkES component via the **`if_OS_Socket`** interface.

### Architecture

Within TRENTOS networking functionality is realized the following way:

- NIC driver CAmkES components implement the driver to the ethernet
    hardware. These components provide the **`if_OS_Nic`** interface.
- A Network Stack CAmkES component implements the IP Stack
    functionality.
  - It uses the interface **`if_OS_Nic`** to communicate to a NIC
        driver. There is a 1:1 relationship between those components.
  - It provides the interface **`if_OS_Socket`** to client CAmkES
        components, that require network functionality. The interface is
        designed so that up to 8 clients can connect to one Network
        Stack. The specific capabilities and client numbers depend on
        the Network Stack component implementation.
- A client CAmkES component that requires network functionality
  - uses the interface **`if_OS_Socket`** to communicate with the Network Stack
        component.
  - Instead of directly using the functions of **`if_OS_Socket`**, it uses the
        Socket API to do so.
  - Clients can open several sockets at a time.
  - A client could be connected to several Network Stacks at the same time.

The Socket API is implemented in a non-blocking way. That means that
every API call will return immediately, but some calls will have a
delayed response. An example of this is **`OS_Socket_connect()`**.

To avoid polling strategies together with the non-blocking API,
**`if_OS_Socket`** implements a notification scheme. The Network Stack
will inform each client about new events related to sockets this client
opened. The clients can retrieve a list of pending events for their
sockets from the Network Stack and react to them accordingly.

The following diagram shows a simplified architecture of a networked
application running on an i.MX6 platform.

### Limitations

- Only IPv4 connections are supported

## Usage

This is how the API can be used by a user component.

### Declaration of API Library in CMake

To use theÂ Socket API, a client needs to link the following project
libraries in the CMake file.

- **os_core_api**: Generic build target to include the TRENTOS core API
- **os_socket_client**: Generic build target to include the Socket API client
    implementation

```CMake
DeclareCAmkESComponent(
    UserComponent
    INCLUDES
        ...
    SOURCES
        ...
    C_FLAGS
        ...
    LIBS
        os_core_api
        os_socket_client
)
```

### Including CAmkES Connectors in the Component Definition

The CAmkES component that wants to use the Socket API needs to include the macro
**`IF_OS_SOCKET_USE`** in its component definition together with a prefix. The
prefix is a unique identifier for that client connection to a specific Network
Stack instance. It needs to be used consistently also in other macros like
**`IF_OS_SOCKET_ASSIGN`** and the macros that connect the client component to
the Network Stack component like
**`NetworkStack_PicoTcp_INSTANCE_CONNECT_CLIENTS`**.

```c
#include <if_OS_Socket.camkes>

component Client {
    IF_OS_SOCKET_USE(<if_OS_Socket_prefix>)
}
```

### Using the API in C

In the implementation, the client needs to set up the RPC lookup table with the
macro **`IF_OS_SOCKET_ASSIGN`** and the \<prefix\> the client used for
**`IF_OS_SOCKET_USE`** .

The created variable (in the example below called **`networkStackCtx`**) can
then be used in the **`OS_Socket_xxx()`** functions provided by the Socket API
as the ctx parameter.

```c
#include "OS_Error.h"

#include "OS_Socket.h"
#include "interfaces/if_OS_Socket.h"
#include <camkes.h>

static const if_OS_Socket_t networkStackCtx =
    IF_OS_SOCKET_ASSIGN(<if_OS_Socket_prefix>);

...

OS_Error_t err;
OS_Socket_Handle_t hsocket;

err = OS_Socket_create(
         &networkStackCtx,
         &hsocket,
         OS_AF_INET,
         OS_SOCK_STREAM);

...

const OS_Socket_Addr_t dstAddr =
{
    .addr = "192.168.1.42",
    .port = 12345
};

err = OS_Socket_connect(hsocket, &dstAddr);

...

OS_Socket_close(hsocket);

...
```

Particularities:

- A return value of **`OS_SUCCESS`** does not mean, that the
    connection is established, but that the connection process was
    successfully initiated.
- The Network Stack will inform the client with a notification about
    the connection process result.
  - A successful connection process will be reported with
        **`OS_SOCK_EV_CONN_EST`** .
  - An unsuccessful connection attempt will be reported with
        **`OS_SOCK_EV_FIN`** or **`OS_SOCK_EV_ERROR`** .
- If during the connection process **`OS_Socket_read()`** or
    **`OS_Socket_write()`** are called, the functions will return with
    **`OS_ERROR_NETWORK_CONN_NONE`** .
- If after an unsuccessful connection process **`OS_Socket_read()`**
    or **`OS_Socket_write()`** are called, the functions will return
    with **`OS_ERROR_CONNECTION_CLOSED`** .
- Following an unsuccessful connection process, the socket handle is
    not usable anymore and needs to be closed with
    **`OS_Socket_close()`** .
- If during the connection process **`OS_Socket_close()`** is called,
    the connection attempt will be canceled.

Particularities:

- **`OS_Socket_read()`** will return as many bytes as have been received from
    the remote host, up to **`requestedLen`**. This may also include data
    received over several ethernet frames.

#### OS_Socket_write

This function will write data on a socket. This function checks if the
socket is bound, connected and that it isn't shut down locally.

```c
OS_Error_t
OS_Socket_write(
    const OS_Socket_Handle_t handle,
    const void* const        buf,
    const size_t             requestedLen,
    size_t* const            actualLen);
```

Parameters:

| Parameter    | Description                                   | Supported Values |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|

|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OS_SUCCESS                          | Operation was successful.                                                                              |

| OS_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER          | If an invalid parameter or NULL pointer was passed.                                                    |
| OS_ERROR_IO                         | If there is an input/output error.                                                                     |

Particularities:

- With **`OS_Socket_write()`** the network stack will copy data to be sent into
    it's internal buffers and schedule it for actual transmission later. If
    errors occur during the actual transmission, those will be reported by
    **`OS_Socket_getPendingEvents()`** / **`OS_SOCK_EV_ERROR`**.
- Depending on the internal buffer capacity of the network stack,
    **`OS_Socket_write()`** may accept only partially the data
    in buf. It will return the number of successfully accepted bytes in
    **`actualLen`**.

#### OS_Socket_recvfrom

This function will receive data from a specified socket. This operation
checks if the socket is bound but not if it is connected and is
therefore not connection-oriented.

```c
OS_Error_t
OS_Socket_recvfrom(
    const OS_Socket_Handle_t handle,
    void* const              buf,
    size_t                   requestedLen,
    size_t* const            actualLen,
    OS_Socket_Addr_t* const  srcAddr);
```

Particularities:

- **`OS_Socket_recvfrom()`** will return the contents of one
    received UDP datagram.
- If the datagram had a payload size of 0, **`OS_Socket_recvfrom()`** will
    return with **`OS_SUCCESS`** and **`actualLen`** of 0.
- If requestedLen is smaller then the the payload size of the datagram,
    **`OS_Socket_recvfrom()`** will return the partial data as requested.
    Following calls to **`OS_Socket_recvfrom()`** will return the remaining data
    of the partially read datagram.

#### OS_Socket_sendto

This function will send data on a destination socket without checking if
the destination is connected or not and is therefore not
connection-oriented.

```c
OS_Error_t
OS_Socket_sendto(
    const OS_Socket_Handle_t      handle,
    const void* const             buf,
    size_t                        requestedLen,
    size_t* const                 actualLen,
    const OS_Socket_Addr_t* const dstAddr);

The events that this function will place in the passed buffer are all of
type **`OS_Socket_Evt_t`**.

```c
typedef struct __attribute__((packed))
{
    int        socketHandle; //!< Handle ID of the socket.
    int        parentSocketHandle; //!< Handle ID of the parent socket.
    uint8_t    eventMask; //!< Event mask of the socket.
    OS_Error_t currentError; //!< Current error of the socket.
}
OS_Socket_Evt_t;
```

The event flags that can be set for the **`eventMask`** member of this
struct and that can be evaluated by the user are listed below.

```c
#define OS_SOCK_EV_NONE      (0)
#define OS_SOCK_EV_CONN_EST  (1<<0) //!< Connection established (TCP only).
#define OS_SOCK_EV_CONN_ACPT (1<<1) //!< Connection accepted (TCP only).

### Non-Blocking Strategies

#### Socket Handling by Polling

In case you have a simple application with a single client connection, you can
omit using the notification sent out by the Network Stack and just use the
Socket API in polling mode.Â  All functions are non-blocking, so a user needs to
read the return values and react properly.

For example, **`OS_Socket_connect()`** will return with **`OS_SUCCESS`** in case
the connection process could be initiated successfully. Read and write calls
will be returned with **`OS_ERROR_NETWORK_CONN_NONE`** until the connection is
established. The code example below shows how this could be realized in a
simplified way.

```c
...

err = OS_Socket_create(
    &networkStackCtx,
    &socket,
    OS_AF_INET,
    OS_SOCK_STREAM);

...


err = OS_Socket_connect(socket, &dstAddr);

...


size_t offs = 0;

do
{
    const size_t lenRemaining = len_request - offs;
    size_t       len_io       = lenRemaining;

    err = OS_Socket_write(
              socket,
              &request[offs],
              len_io,
              &len_io);
    if (err != OS_SUCCESS)
    {
        if (err == OS_ERROR_TRY_AGAIN || err == OS_ERROR_NETWORK_CONN_NONE)
        {
   // Try again.
   continue;
        }
        else
        {
            Debug_LOG_ERROR("OS_Socket_write() failed, code %d", err);
            OS_Socket_close(socket);
            return;
        }
    }

    offs += len_io;
}
while (offs < len_request);

...
```

#### Socket Handling by Main Event Loop

For more complex implementations it is advised to use the notification sent out
by the Network Stack and retrieve the details about all pending events via
**`OS_Socket_getPendingEvents()`**.

The NetworkStack_PicoTcp will cyclically process all incoming data and existing
connections. When an update happens for any of the open sockets, it will send a
notification to the client that the socket belongs to. Please note, that no
individual notifications are sent for each socket. Instead, only one
notification is sent after each processing cycle of the Network Stack.

A client can retrieve a list of all events from the Network Stack by calling
**`OS_Socket_getPendingEvents()`**. This will return an array of events for all
updated sockets. The client can then process each event and react appropriately.

One strategy to make use of this is to include an endless loop in the run()
function and wait for the notification to be triggered. After receiving the
notification we retrieve the pending events, act on all events, tidy up tasks,
and wait again on the notification.

```c
...

int
run()
{
    ...

    for (;;)
    {
        // Wait until we get an event for the listening socket.
        OS_Socket_wait(&networkStackCtx);

        err = OS_Socket_getPendingEvents(
                &network_stack,
                evtBuffer,
                evtBufferSize,
                &numberOfSocketsWithEvents);

        ...

        // Verify that the received number of sockets with events is within expected
        // bounds.

     ...

  // Iterate through the received socket events and handle them according to the application logic.
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfSocketsWithEvents; i++)
        {
   OS_Socket_Evt_t event;
            memcpy(&event, &evtBuffer[offset], sizeof(event));
            offset += sizeof(event);

   // Socket has been closed by the network stack - close socket.
            if (event.eventMask & OS_SOCK_EV_FIN)
            {
                OS_Socket_close(socket);
       continue;
            }

          ...

  }
    }

    ...

}

...
```

#### Socket Handling by Notification Callback

The CAmkES infrastructure for the **`if_OS_Socket`** interface provides the
functionality to register a callback function that is executed once the Network
Stack sends a notification (see also the API documentation above for more
details on how to register a callback function). It is therefore possible to
also implement a scheme to handle the socket events that rely on this mechanism
to update the current event state for all sockets a client is managing.

While this strategy can provide certain benefits it should also be noted that
this typically results in a more complex solution, since the callback function
is executed in a separate thread and can result in concurrency issues.
Additional synchronization primitives will therefore be necessary on the user
application side.

The example below provides a sketch of how this strategy can be implemented and
what API functions would need to be involved for this approach.

```c
...

static OS_Socket_Evt_t eventCollection[OS_NETWORK_MAXIMUM_SOCKET_NO] = {0};

...

static void
cb_nwStackNotification(
    void* ctx)
{

    ...

    OS_Error_t err = OS_Socket_getPendingEvents(
                         ctx,
                         eventBuffer,
                         bufferSize,
                         &numberOfSocketsWithEvents);

 ...

    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfSocketsWithEvents; i++)
    {
        // Update local eventCollection[OS_NETWORK_MAXIMUM_SOCKET_NO] array
        // with the latest events for the sockets. The update of this shared
  // ressource should be mutex protected in case the run() thread is
        // currently also trying to access it.
    }

    // Unblock any caller of the functions below waiting for new events to
    // arrive.
    if (numberOfSocketsWithEvents)
    {
        notify_about_new_events();
    }

    // Re-register the callback function as it should be executed again for the
    // next notification.
    err = OS_Socket_regCallback(
              ctx,
              &cb_nwStackNotification,
              ctx);
 ...

}

...

OS_Error_t
waitForConnectionEstOnSocket(
    const OS_Socket_Handle_t handle)
{
    ...

    for(;;)
    {
        // Lock mutex for shared eventCollection ressource

        eventMask = eventCollection[handle.handleID].eventMask;
        err = eventCollection[handle.handleID].currentError;

        // Unlock mutex for shared eventCollection ressource

  // Check eventMask for the specific events that might be relevant
        // to evaluate.

  // If a relevant event is found to be set in the eventMask
        // (e.g. OS_SOCK_EV_CONN_EST) return OS_SUCCESS. If and error
        // is found with OS_SOCK_EV_ERROR, return err.

  // Else if no relevant event is found, wait on the arrival of new events.
        // The signal would be emitted by the callback function in this example.
    }
}

...

int
run()
{

    ...

    // Set up callback for new received socket events.
    err = OS_Socket_regCallback(
              &networkStackCtx,
              &cb_nwStackNotification,
              (void*) &networkStackCtx);
    ...

 err = OS_Socket_create(
    &networkStackCtx,
    &socket,
    OS_AF_INET,
    OS_SOCK_STREAM);

    ...

    err = OS_Socket_connect(socket, &dstAddr);

    ...

 // Wait until the socket is successfully connected.
    err = waitForConnectionEstOnSocket(handle);

    ...

}

...
```

## Further Examples

To get a better understanding of how the Network Stack can be utilized in a
system, it is recommended to take a look at the demos provided by the SDK.

In the IoT Demos, a Cloud Connector component is connected to a Network Stack
component as a TCP client and uses the networking functionalities to publish
MQTT messages from a Sensor component connected to it.

In the demo_tls_api a TLS connection is established, in which the main component
needs to setup the TCP connection to a remote server.
