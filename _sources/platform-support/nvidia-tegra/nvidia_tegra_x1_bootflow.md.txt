### Bootflow
The Jetson Nano boot process is split into several individual steps (see here), which are executed by two distinct processors:

- Boot and Power Management Processor (BPMP): a dedicated ARM7 co-processor, with 256 KB internal RAM (IRAM) for both code and data, designed to handle the early stages of the boot process and offloading the power management (e.g. entering deep low power state, suspend to ram), clock management (e.g. offloading DRAM memory clock scaling), and reset control tasks from the CPU
    - at boot
        - Phase 1: execute boot code stored in hard-wired BootROM (iROM) in Secure/TZ mode to
            - initialize the boot media (QSPI)
            - load BootROM Boot Configuration Table (BCT, P3448_A00_lpddr4_204Mhz_P987.bct) from the start of the boot media, which contains
                - configuration parameters used by the BootROM for hardware initialization
                - information about the bootloader (BL), e.g. size, entry point, load address and hash
            - validate and load the bootloader (TegraBoot, nvtboot.bin) from boot media to shared on-chip memory (SysRAM)
        - Phase 2: execute TegraBoot (a cold boot and a recovery boot/flashing variant exist) from SysRAM to
            - switch from Secure/TZ to Non-Secure/Non-TZ mode
            - start releasing console output on the debugging serial port
            - read PMIC reset section
            - initialize SDRAM
            - create memory carveouts
            - load and initialize firmware (FW) components, depending on selected mode
                - cold boot: reset or power on
                    - Tboot-CPU (nvtboot_cpu.bin)
                    - Bootloader DTB (tegra210-p3448-0003-p3542-0000.dtb)
                    - Linux Kernel DTB (tegra210-p3448-0003-p3542-0000.dtb)
                    - CBoot (cboot.bin)
                    - NCT (not found)
                    - optional: non-bootloader related code (BPMP-FW) executed by the BPMP
                        - SC7 Entry Firmware (sc7entry-firmware.bin)
                        - Warm boot binary (warmboot.bin)
                    - Monitor/ATF (tos-mon-only.img)
                - warm boot: resume from a suspended state, requiring a different set of configurations
                - recovery mode: handle communication to the flash/upgrade path via USB
            - load the next stage bootloader (Cboot)
            - load bootloader device tree and pass device tree load address to Cboot
            - complete CPU initialization
                - enable CPU power rail
                - enable CPU clock
                - perform RAM repair
            - support flashing
            - support RCM boot
            - release/start CPU (CCPLEX) and halt BPMP co-processor
        - at runtime
            - BPMP Firmware (BPMP-FW): provides various services related to runtime power management & acts as communication path between CPU and BPMP
                - runtime core residing mainly in DRAM, but may also affect IRAM
                - owns particular hardware resources and prevents the CPU from directly accessing them
                - offers proxy services to give the CPU indirect access
                - communication between BPMP and CPU via shared memory mailboxes and the PSCI
                    - Linux BPMP firmware driver: used to create create the interprocessor communication (IPC) between the CPU and BPMP, utilizing the binding document
    - CPU: the actual 64-bit ARM processor, here consisting of 4x ARM Cortex-A57 cores
        - Phase 3: EL3 Monitor/ATF
            - executes in EL3
            - transfers control to CBoot
        - Phase 4: CBoot - main EL2 bootloader for the CPU
            - fully fledged SMP aware kernel based off Little Kernel
            - source code not provided for Jetson Nano: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/jetson-nano-cboot/129542
            - starts in EL3 mode and begins executing TOS; TOS completetes its initialization and passes control back to CBoot in EL2 mode
            - uses
                - DTB to configure the system
                - I2C EEPROMs on both module and carrier board to perform modifications to the device tree for enabling/disabling nodes and add extra information
            - loads firmware into USB3 controller
            - initializes any display
            - shows a boot image
            - releases the BPMP & allows to begin executing the previously loaded BPMP-FW
            - loads U-Boot & transfers control to it
        - Phase 5: U-Boot
            - access to programmable fuses allow to store keys for secure boot/signed binaries â†’ U-Boot can use signed FIT images, providing a secure boot up to the Linux kernel
            - loads the Linux kernel & transfers control to it
        - Phase 6: Linux kernel
