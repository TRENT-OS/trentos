## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [TRENTOS Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [info.cyber@hensoldt.net](mailto:info.cyber@hensoldt.net).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().
TODO: Link documentation

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide the used hardware platform, if its executed in qemu or on hardware and everything that seems relevant to you.
- Please label your issue with the "Question" label.

We try to respond to your question as soon as possible.

This ensures HENSOLDT Cyber GmbH stays the sole copyright owner of TRENTOS. Of course you retain your right to use your contribution in any way you see fit.

When opening a Pull Request you will be automatically asked to sign our CLA in case you have not already signed it.

If you have any questions about our [CLA](https://gist.github.com/HensoldtCyber/12ced530d8cab01c768a1025cd2a60b4#file-contributer-license-agreement) please do not hesitate to contact us under [info.cyber@hensoldt.net](mailto:info.cyber@hensoldt.net).

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. errors in CAmkES Files (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
TODO: Link Documentation
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Syslog output
- Hardware platform, if its executed in qemu or on hardware
- Used components and libraries
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [info.cyber@hensoldt.net](mailto:info.cyber@hensoldt.net).

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) and label it as "bug".
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. 
<!-- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).-->
- We will try to find a solution for the problem. Please update the issues if you have any possible solutions or leads. 

### Submitting an Enhancement

Please feel free to create an issue describing your enhancement.

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) and label it as "enhancement".
- Clearly describe your enhancement 
- Layout your expected benefit for you and other users.

### Improving documentation

Improvements of the documentation are always welcome. <br />
Please open a pull request with your changes in the [TRENTOS Docs](https://github.com/trent-os/docs) repository.
If you have a question about the current documentation please [open an issue](https://github.com/TRENT-OS/docs/issues/new).
