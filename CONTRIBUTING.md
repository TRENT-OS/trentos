## How to contribute to TRENTOS

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in TRENTOS**, and instead send an email to [info.cyber@hensoldt.net](mailto:info.cyber@hensoldt.net?subject=TRENTOS:%20Security%20Vulnerability).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/TRENT-OS/trentos/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/TRENT-OS/trentos/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* If the bug is in one of the submodules, please open a pull request in all modules up to the TRENTOS root repository. The root repository is the central place for all pull requests.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Please open an issue in advance and get some feedback and advice on the proposed feature. If you already have code to contribute, feel free to open a pull request.

* Any pull request in one of the submodules must be accompanied by pull requests moving the feature commit into the root repository.


#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Feel free to open an issue and describing your question.


#### **Do you want to contribute to the TRENTOS documentation?**

* Open an issue and tag it with the `documentation` label. Describe you intended changes and or open a pull request with your changes and link it.
