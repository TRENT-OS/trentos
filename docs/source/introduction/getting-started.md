### Setup your TRENTOS Workspace

Within the scope of this document, we assume that a Linux system is used
since all the listed commands have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04
LTS or newer. TRENTOS is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TRENT-OS/trentos) and the required docker containers are available via DockerHub:

```sh
# Create a new folder for TRENTOS
mkdir trentos && cd trentos

# Recursively clone the TRENTOS project
git clone --recursive git@github.com:TRENT-OS/trentos.git src
```

Most of the commands used in later parts of the document assume a
terminal is open in the **trentos** directory and where this is
not the case it will be explicitly stated. Also, we will refer to the
**trentos** directory as the **SDK root directory**.

Finally, it is important to note that by default, all the build
artifacts are stored in the SDK root directory which can be changed by
the user by modifying arguments in the build script invocation. This is
discussed in the [Buildsystem](../development/buildsystem.md) chapter of the
TRENTOS Handbook. In the following section, we will go over the contents of the
unpacked archive.

## Setup

As a prerequisite, the docker engine needs to be installed on your development
machine. An installation guide for the engine can be found at
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
This tutorial assumes you have a working docker service installed on your
machine and that your current user is a member of the **docker** and **sudo**
group.

## Install the Docker Images

To install these docker images on your machine, open a terminal and run the commands below.
Due to the size of the docker images, this can take several minutes.

```sh
docker pull hensoldtcyber/trentos_build:latest
docker pull hensoldtcyber/trentos_test:latest
```

Verify that the docker images are installed properly by running.

```sh
docker images
```

This should result in the following output, especially the values in the column
**IMAGE ID** must match. The column **CREATED** may differ, since it gives the
time delta since creation.

```console
REPOSITORY                    TAG       IMAGE ID         CREATED         SIZE
hensoldtcyber/trentos_test    latest    a8ce644de82c     3 weeks ago     1.79GB
hensoldtcyber/trentos_build   latest    d3dffe4123e3     2 months ago    8.69GB
```

### Use the Docker Images

The docker containers based on the docker images can be used in two different
ways:

- interactively, i.e. using a shell inside the container. This is the
    default mode if no further arguments are given.

- non-interactively, i.e. using the container to execute a command or
    a script. This is the recommended way for build pipelines.

Note that containers are not persistent, i.e. all changes inside the container
(except changes on the mounted folder from the host system) are lost once it is
closed.

#### Use Container in Interactive Mode

Note that the current working directory on the host is mounted into the docker
container under **/host**, so subfolders are accessible within the container but
not the parent folder.

To open the **trentos_build** docker container in the interactive mode, run this
command:

```bash
# start bash in a new trentos_build container
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_build_env.sh
```

To leave the container enter **exit**.

Similarly, for the **trentos_test** docker container the command is:

```bash
# start bash in a new trentos_test container
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_test_env.sh
```

To leave the container enter **exit**.

Each of these commands **starts a new container instance** which allows further
user interaction from within the container.

#### Use Container in Non-Interactive Mode

Note that the current working directory on the host is mounted into the docker
container under **/host**, so the command or script can access subfolders but
not the parent folder.

To run a command or a script in the **trentos_build** docker container, run this
command:

```bash
# execute a specific script in a new trentos_build container
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_build_env.sh <path_to_build_script>
```

Similarly, for the **trentos_test** docker container the command is:

```bash
# execute a specific script in a new trentos_test container
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_test_env.sh <path_to_test_script>
```

Each of these commands **starts a new container instance**, executes the command
or script, and stops the container afterwards.

#### Use the Network of the Test Container

The **trentos_test** docker container automatically sets up the network
interface and configures access permissions. The IP address 172.17.0.x is
assigned automatically to each **trentos_test** docker container, starting from
x = 2 for the first started container.

Additionally it creates an internal subnet with the address 10.0.0.0/24 and the
IP address of the **trentos_test** docker container is 10.0.0.1. This network is
hidden behind a NAT and the following port ranges are forwarded:

- Port range 10000:10999 for TCP and UDP is forwarded to 10.0.0.10

- Port range 11000:11999 for TCP and UDP is forwarded to 10.0.0.11

Verify that network and internet access from within the container is possible by
pinging a server in interactive mode:

```bash
# start bash in a new trentos_test container
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_test_env.sh

# execute ping
ping -c 3 hensoldt-cyber.com
```

To leave the container enter **exit**.

#### Container Commands

For easier access to the containers it is also possible to add the folder
**sdk/scripts** to your **PATH** variable and execute the
**sdk/scripts/install_bashrc.sh** script. This adds **open_trentos_build_env**
**and open_trentos_test_env** as commands to bash (i.e. it will copy the
contents of **bash_functions.def** to your **.bashrc** file). The container
commands can be used directly instead of calling the scripts with the path.

## TRENTOS in QEMU

### Build a TRENTOS System

The following section demonstrates the general build process of a TRENTOS system
for QEMU. The Hello World demo shipped with the SDK is used as an example use
case. Building a TRENTOS system is done by executing the **build-system.sh**
script within the **trentos_build** docker container. The **build-system.sh**
script takes the following arguments:

- Project directory: the directory that contains the source files of
    the project to be built (here **sdk/demos/demo_hello_world** is the
    path to the Hello World source folder from the SDK root directory)

- Build platform: the underlying hardware platform, for which the
    TRENTOS system shall be built (here **zynq7000**, which targets the
    Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC that can be emulated by QEMU)

- Output directory: the directory in which the built artifacts are
    stored (here **build-zynq7000-Debug-demo_hello_world**)

- Build type: the actual build type reflecting the purpose of the
    TRENTOS system to be built (here **-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug** that
    causes the CMake build system to create a **Debug** build)

The following command will invoke the build script from inside the
**trentos_build** docker container. Upon start, docker will mount the current
working directory into the docker container under **/host**, execute the build,
and then remove the container again. Then the script is executed in the
container and the container is removed once the script finishes. For the Hello
World demo, this call looks like the following:

```bash
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_build_env.sh src/build.sh demo_hello_world
```

If the build is successful, the console produces the following output:

```console
##------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## build successful, output in build-zynq7000-Debug-demo_hello_world
##==============================================================================
```

As a result, the folder **build-zynq7000-Debug-demo_hello_world** is
created in the SDK root directory, containing all the build artifacts.

**Congratulations, you have successfully built your first secure TRENTOS
system!**

More details on the build system can be found in the TRENTOS Handbook in
the [Buildsystem](../development/buildsystem.md) chapter.

### Run a TRENTOS System

Similar to the build script above, the following command will invoke the
run script from inside the **trentos_test** docker container. Upon
start, docker will mount the current working directory  into the docker
container under **/host**, execute the run script and then remove the
container again. For the Hello World demo, this call looks like the
following:

```bash
# change to the build output folder
cd build-zynq7000-Debug-demo_hello_world
# execute the Hello World demo in the trentos_test container
../src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_test_env.sh ./simulate
```

Note that in this case the **simulate** run script must be invoked from
within the build output folder **build-zynq7000-Debug-demo_hello_world**.
This requires the change to this directory and the invocation of the
test container there. Remember to change back to the SDK root directory
for the following steps.

After successful execution, the following output can be expected:

```console
Booting all finished, dropped to user space
main@main.c:2125 Starting CapDL Loader...
main@main.c:2127 CapDL Loader done, suspending...
hello world!
```

**Congratulations, you have successfully run your first secure TRENTOS
system!**

To exit QEMU and the container, press <Ctrl-A\> and <X\>.

## TRENTOS on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+

This chapter describes how to run the Hello World demo standalone on the
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (RPi3B+) without using the **trentos_test** docker
container and QEMU.

### Build a TRENTOS System

The following section demonstrates the general build process of a
TRENTOS system for the RPi3B+. The Hello World demo shipped with the SDK
is used as an example use case.

The build process is similar to the one for the **zynq7000** target as shown
above. It only differs in the underlying hardware platform type, which
in this case is the **rpi3** platform.

The following command will invoke the build script from inside
the **trentos_build** docker container. The container will mount the
current working directory under **/host**, execute the script and then
remove itself.

```bash
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_build_env.sh \
    src/sdk/build-system.sh \
    src/sdk/demos/demo_hello_world \
    rpi3 \
    build-rpi3-Debug-demo_hello_world \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

As a result, the folder **build-rpi3-Debug-demo_hello_world** is created in the
SDK root directory, containing all the build artifacts.

### Hardware Setup

In order to run the demo, the following is required:

- RPi3B+ incl. power supply

- UART-to-USB adapter

- MicroSD card (formatted with MBR/DOS partitioning)

Before building or executing the demo it is necessary to first properly
connect all the hardware components:

- connect the UART-to-USB adapter to the RPi3B+ board

- connect the UART-to-USB adapter to your PC

- connect the RPi3B+ board to the power supply

The following diagram shows the hardware setup:
!["Getting Started - RPi3B+ HW Setup"](img/getting-started_rpi-hw-setup.png)

### SD Card Setup

**Info:** The RPi3B+ requires SD cards to use an MBR partition table. If this is
not the case (e.g. partition table uses GPT format) the board will not boot at
all. Thus, if your RPi3B+ does not boot or does not give you any output on the
console interface even if the SD contains all required files, make sure to
verify that the card is MBR ("MS-DOS") formatted. A step-by-step guide on how to
create an MBR partitioned SD card can be found in the
[Using an SD Card with a TRENTOS System](../platform-support/using-sd-card-with-trentos.md)
section in the TRENTOS Handbook.

Before the TRENTOS image can be executed on the RPi3B+ platform it is necessary
to first prepare the SD card with the necessary files provided as part of the
SDK package. To do so, it is enough to do the following:

- Remove the SD card from the RPi3B+ and connect it to your PC. In the
    following steps, we assume that the SD card is mounted at
    **<sd_card_mount_point>**.

- Copy required files to the SD card (More information on each
    individual file and its role for the execution of a TRENTOS system
    can be found in the
    [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](../platform-support/rpi-3-model-b+/platform.md)
    section in the TRENTOS Handbook).

```bash
# copy bootfiles to SD card
cp src/sdk/resources/rpi3_sd_card/* <sd_card_mount_point>/
```

- After copying the required bootfiles it is necessary to copy the
    TRENTOS image to the SD card as well.

```bash
# copy TRENTOS system image to SD card
cp build-rpi3-Debug-demo_hello_world/images/os_image.elf <sd_card_mount_point>/

# ensure files are written to the SD card
sync
umount <sd_card_mount_point>
```

### Run a TRENTOS System

After preparing the SD card, we want to run the TRENTOS system on the RPi3B+. In
order to observe the UART output from the RPi3B+, we have to start a serial
monitor that shows the traffic received from the UART-to-USB adapter. One way of
doing this is to use the **picocom** utility with the following command. If the
**picocom** package is not already available on the system, it can be installed
with a package manager (e.g. **apt**).

```bash
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/<ttyUSBX>
```

Hereby, **<ttyUSBX\>** acts as a placeholder for the specific device
representing the USB-to-UART adapter, e.g. **ttyUSB0**. Note that using **sudo**
may not be required, this depends on your Linux group membership giving your
account access to  **/dev/<ttyUSBX\>**.

Once the terminal is open, insert the SD card into the RPi3B+ and restart the
board with a power cycle. The terminal should show the RPi3B+ booting and
eventually running the Hello World demo saying "hello world!".

```console
U-Boot 2020.07-rc3-00002-g4b6f96a0a6 (May 26 2020 - 18:38:13 +0200)...
Bootstrapping kernel
Booting all finished, dropped to user space
main@main.c:2125 Starting CapDL Loader...
main@main.c:2127 CapDL Loader done, suspending...
hello world!
```

To exit **picocom**, press <Ctrl-A\> and <Ctrl-X\>.

## TRENTOS on the Nitrogen6_SoloX

This chapter describes how to run the Hello World demo standalone on the
Nitrogen6_SoloX without using the **trentos_test** docker container
and QEMU.

### Build a TRENTOS System

The following section demonstrates the general build process of a TRENTOS system
for the Nitrogen6_SoloX. The Hello World demo shipped with the SDK is used as an
example use case.

The build process is similar to the one for the RPi3B+ target as shown above. It
only differs in the underlying hardware platform type, which in this case is the
**nitrogen6sx** platform.

The following command will invoke the build script from inside the
**trentos_build** docker container. The container will mount the current working
directory under **/host**, execute the script and then remove itself.

```bash
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_build_env.sh \
    src/sdk/build-system.sh \
    src/sdk/demos/demo_hello_world \
    nitrogen6sx \
    build-nitrogen6sx-Debug-demo_hello_world \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

As a result, the folder **build-nitrogen6sx-Debug-demo_hello_world** is created
in the SDK root directory, containing all the build artifacts.

### Hardware Setup

In order to run the demo, the following is required:

- Nitrogen6_SoloX incl. power supply

- UART-to-USB adapter

- MicroSD card (formatted)

Before building or executing the demo it is necessary to first properly connect
all the hardware components:

- connect the UART-to-USB adapter to the Nitrogen6_SoloX

- connect the UART-to-USB adapter to your PC

- connect the Nitrogen6_SoloX board to the power supply

The following diagram shows the hardware setup:

!["Getting Started -Nitrogen6_SoloX HW Setup"](img/getting-started_nitrogen6-solox-setup.png)

### SD Card Setup

Before the TRENTOS image can be executed on the Nitrogen6_SoloX platform it is
necessary to first prepare the SD card with the necessary files provided as part
of the SDK package. To do so, it is enough to do the following.

- Remove the SD card from the Nitrogen6_SoloX and connect it to your PC. In the
    following steps, we assume that the SD card is mounted at
    **\<sd_card_ount_point\>**.

- Copy the required bootfiles to the SD card. (More information on each
    individual file and its role for the execution of a TRENTOS system can be
    found in the [Nitrogen6_SoloX](../platform-support/nitrogen6-solo-x/platform.md)
    section in the TRENTOS Handbook.)

```bash
# copy bootfiles to SD card
cp src/sdk/resources/nitrogen6sx_sd_card/* <sd_card_mount_point>/
```

- After copying the required bootfiles it is necessary to copy the TRENTOS image
    to the SD card as well.

```bash
# copy TRENTOS system image to SD card
cp src/build-nitrogen6sx-Debug-demo_hello_world/images/os_image.elf <sd_card_mount_point>/

# ensure files are written to the SD card
sync
umount <sd_card_mount_point>
```

### Upgrade U-Boot in Flash

The Nitrogen6_SoloX needs to be prepared with a specific U-Boot image to
successfully boot a TRENTOS system. With the preparation of the previous step,
the SD card now contains the required U-Boot image which needs to be installed
into the board\'s internal flash. This process requires to interact with the
board through its UART port, so a serial monitor and the UART-to-USB adapter
have to be used. One way of doing this is to use the **picocom** utility with
the following command. If the **picocom** package is not already available on
the system, it can be installed with a package manager (e.g. **apt**).

```bash
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/<ttyUSBX>
```

Hereby, **<ttyUSBX\>** acts as a placeholder for the specific device
representing the USB-to-UART adapter, e.g. **ttyUSB0**. Note that using **sudo**
may not be required, this depends on your Linux group membership giving your
account access to **/dev/<ttyUSBX\>**.

Once the terminal is open, insert the SD card into the Nitrogen6_SoloX board and
restart the board with a power cycle.

Observer the UART output in a terminal window running **picocom** as described
above. Interrupt the boot process by pressing <Enter\> when the console outputs
\"Hit any key to stop autoboot\".

```console
U-Boot 2018.07-36536-gb89e53e64c (Aug 31 2020 - 17:16:55 +0200)
CPU: Freescale i.MX6SX rev1.3 at 792 MHz

Hit any key to stop autoboot: 1
```

Run the following command to upgrade U-Boot in the board\'s internal
flash (note the u at the end):

```bash
=> run upgradeu
```

This will run the **upgrade.scr** script found on the prepared SD card, search
for the **u-boot.imx** file and flash it.

Once the process has successfully completed, the board's internal flash should
now contain the new version of U-Boot. On success you should see the following

### Run a TRENTOS System

After preparing the SD card and upgrading U-Boot in the board's internal flash,
we want to run the TRENTOS system on the Nitrogen6_SoloX.

Restart the board with a power cycle or by pressing the restart button on the
board. The terminal should show the board booting and eventually running the
Hello World demo saying "hello world!".

```console
U-Boot 2018.07-36539-ge26f5ffed7 (Nov 24 2020 - 20:36:55 +0100)...
Bootstrapping kernel
Booting all finished, dropped to user space
main@main.c:2125 Starting CapDL Loader...
main@main.c:2127 CapDL Loader done, suspending...
hello world!
```

To exit **picocom**, press <Ctrl-A\> and <Ctrl-X\>.

## TRENTOS on the BD-SL-i.MX6

This chapter describes how to run the Hello World demo standalone on the
BD-SL-i.MX6 (also known as Sabre Lite) without using the **trentos_test** docker
container and QEMU.

### Build a TRENTOS System

The following section demonstrates the general build process of a TRENTOS system
for the BD-SL-i.MX6. The Hello World demo shipped with the SDK is used as an
example use case.

The build process is similar to the one for the RPi3B+ target as shown above. It
only differs in the underlying hardware platform type, which in this case is the
**sabre** platform.

The following command will invoke the build script from inside the
**trentos_build** docker container. The container will mount the current working
directory under **/host**, execute the script and then remove itself.

```bash
src/sdk/scripts/open_trentos_build_env.sh \
    src/sdk/build-system.sh \
    src/sdk/demos/demo_hello_world \
    sabre \
    build-sabre-Debug-demo_hello_world \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

As a result, the folder **build-sabre-Debug-demo_hello_world** is created in the
SDK root directory, containing all the build artifacts.

### Hardware Setup

In order to run the demo, the following is required:

- BD-SL-i.MX6 incl. power supply

- UART-to-USB adapter

- MicroSD card (formatted)

Before building or executing the demo it is necessary to first properly
connect all the hardware components:

- connect the UART-to-USB adapter to the BD-SL-i.MX6

- connect the UART-to-USB adapter to your PC

- connect the BD-SL-i.MX6 board to the power supply

The following diagram shows the hardware setup:

!["Getting Started - BD-SL-i.MX6 HW Setup"](img/getting-started_bd-sl-imx6.png)

### SD Card Setup

Before the TRENTOS image can be executed on the BD-SL-i.MX6 platform it is
necessary to first prepare the SD card with necessary files provided as part of
the SDK package. To do so, it is enough to do the following:

- Remove the SD card from the BD-SL-i.MX6 and connect it to your PC.
    In the following steps, we assume that the SD card is mounted at
    **<sd_card_mount_point\>**.

- Copy the required bootfiles to the SD card. (More information on
    each individual file and its role for the execution of a TRENTOS
    system can be found in
    the [BD-SL-i.MX6](../platform-support/bd-sl-i.mx6/platform.md) section
    in the TRENTOS Handbook.)

```bash
# copy bootfiles to SD card
cp src/sdk/resources/sabre_sd_card/* <sd_card_mount_point>/
```

- After copying the required bootfiles it is necessary to copy the
    TRENTOS image to the SD card as well:

```bash
# copy TRENTOS system image to SD card
cp build-sabre-Debug-demo_hello_world/images/os_image.elf <sd_card_mount_point>/
# ensure files are written to the SD card
sync
umount <sd_card_mount_point>
```

### Upgrade U-Boot in Flash

The BD-SL-i.MX6 needs to be prepared with a specific U-Boot image to
successfully boot a TRENTOS system. With the preparation of the previous step,
the SD card now contains the required U-Boot image which needs to be installed
into the board's internal flash. This process requires to interact with the
board through its UART port, so a serial monitor and the UART-to-USB adapter
have to be used. One way of doing this is to use the **picocom** utility with
the following command. If the **picocom** package is not already available on
the system, it can be installed with a package manager (e.g. **apt**).

```bash
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/<ttyUSBX>
```

Hereby, **<ttyUSBX\>** acts as a placeholder for the specific device
representing the USB-to-UART adapter, e.g. **ttyUSB0**. Note that using **sudo**
may not be required, this depends on your Linux group membership giving your
account access to **/dev/<ttyUSBX\>**.

Once the terminal is open, insert the SD card into the BD-SL-i.MX6 board and
restart the board with a power cycle or by pressing the restart button on the
board.

Observer the UART output in a terminal window running **picocom** as described
above. Interrupt the boot process by pressing <Enter\> when the console outputs
"Hit any key to stop autoboot".

```console

```

Run the following command to upgrade U-Boot in the board's internal flash (note
the u at the end):

```bash
=> run upgradeu
```

This will run the upgrade.scr script found on the prepared SD card, search for
the **u-boot.imx** file and flash it.

Once the process has successfully completed, the board\'s internal flash should
now contain the new version of U-Boot. On success you should see the following
output:

```console

### Run a TRENTOS System

After preparing the SD card and upgrading U-Boot in the board's internal flash,
we want to run the TRENTOS system on the BD-SL-i.MX6.

Restart the board with a power cycle or by pressing the restart button on the
board. The terminal should show the board booting and eventually running the
Hello World demo saying "hello world!".

```console
U-Boot 2018.07-36526-gdfb8018f53 (Aug 06 2020 - 18:57:51 +0200)...
Bootstrapping kernel
Booting all finished, dropped to user space
main@main.c:2125 Starting CapDL Loader...
main@main.c:2127 CapDL Loader done, suspending...
hello world!
```

To exit **picocom**, press <Ctrl-A\> and <Ctrl-X\>.

## Further Steps

Please have a look at the handbook at
**sdk/doc/pdf/TRENTOS_Handbook_SDK_V1.3.pdf** for more information about the
individual components and how to set up the other demo systems.

You could start with:

- look into one of the demos, build and run it

- dive deeper into seL4 and CAmkES

- dive deeper into the TRENTOS components

Once you have acquired the necessary understanding of the TRENTOS system, start
developing your own applications and components.
